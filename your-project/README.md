## Project Description
This project is an analysis of accidents that took place in Barcelona. Since I am new to the city, as well as my project partner, we decided to research a little more about accidents here: how serious are they? are there many? Where do they take place and how? This way, we thought we could feel safer moving around in a new town.

## Questions & Hypotheses
There were many questions to be answered. All of them are stated in the repository, under the folder "material". The main ones were:

- What are "accidents" in this database: deaths? injuries? occurances without victims?
- How many accidents happen in Barcelona? Is this a dangerous city in that matter?
- What are the accidents about? Cars running over people? Bikes and pedestrians?
- When do they happen?
- Where do accidents happen? And why there?
- Is the neighborhood of our campus safe when it comes to accidents?

Our main hypothesis were:
- Most accidents happen where there are most people, so most populated areas
- Barcelona is not a dangerous place
- Most accidents happen on weekend nights

## Dataset
Maily, four datasets were used for this project, all of them provided by Barcelona government.
1. Accidents in Barcelona (2019, 2018, 2017)- avilable under folder "data"
2. Public transport stops in BCN- avilable under folder "data"
3. Bus stops in BCN- avilable under folder "data"
4. Population of Barcelona- avilable under "population" and then "data"


## Database
The datasets were analised individually, and then compared.
All of the datasets had the column neighborhood, so to work our analysis better, we grouped data by neighbordhood.


## Workflow
The workflow was as it follows:
- Pic topics and discuss with partner
- Create trello board
- Ask questions and hypothesis under the theme we chose
- Gather data
- Analysing each data set individually
- Combine datasets and analyze them
- Gather and discuss insights
- Create a storytelling that is engaging and delivers information
- Make presentation

## Organization
For this project, we used trello and shared google drive documents (sheets and presentation).
In the repository you'll find a folder namer "your-project".
In this folder, there is another called "data", with datasets. We used the ones under "transportation" and one under "population".
You'll also find a folder named "Material", which contains the presentation file, the questions we used to guide our analysis, and some extra files.
